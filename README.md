## Description
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects you’re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118.This weeks project will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. Based on attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other characteristic attributes, patients will be classified according to varying degrees of coronary artery disease. This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients and distributed by the UCI Deep Learning Repository.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Jupiter Notebook/Google Colab


## Metric Of Success
We will need to build a neural network model that corrrectly predicts the likelihood of heart disease occurence. We will need to find the best parameter and evaluate the performance based on the accuracy score and confusion metrics. We will aim for an accuracy score of at least 80%
