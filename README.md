## Description
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects youâ€™re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118.This weeks project will focus on predicting heart disease using neural networks. Based on attributes such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other characteristic attributes, patients will be classified according to varying degrees of coronary artery disease. This project will utilize a dataset of 303 patients and distributed by the UCI Deep Learning Repository.
